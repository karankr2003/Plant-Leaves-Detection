Abstract for project:-

	Plant disease detection system has been a necessity for cultivators as detection of a correct disease might lead to a proper yield and effective growth of the plant. The detection of plant diseases is essential for ensuring optimal crop yields and minimizing losses in agriculture. Traditional methods of disease detection often involve manual inspection by trained experts, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

	This approach involves capturing images of plant leaves and analyzing them using computer vision algorithms to identify signs of disease. This paper presents an abstract of a study on the detection of plant disease using image processing. The study aims to explore the effectiveness of various image processing techniques, such as segmentation and feature extraction, for detecting plant diseases. 

	The results of the study demonstrate the potential of image processing techniques for accurately detecting plant diseases, thereby enabling timely interventions to prevent crop losses.
