# Plant Leaves Detection

## Project Overview
The Plant Leaves Detection project aims to identify and classify different types of leaves based on their morphological features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. This project is implemented on Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, providing a seamless platform for running and sharing machine learning experiments.

## Language
- Python

## Tool
- Google Colab

## Machine Learning
- The project employs a Machine Learning algorithm, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to perform the classification tasks.
- The CNN model is trained to recognize and differentiate various types of leaves from the given dataset.
- The output of the project is the classification of the leaves, accurately identifying the type of leaf based on its features.

## Features
- Implementation of CNN for leaf classification.
- Utilizes the computational power of Google Colab for model training and testing.
- Easy to run and modify the code for further experiments and improvements.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/karankr2003/Plant_Leaves_Detection.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Google Colab:
    - Upload the project files to your Google Drive.
    - Open Google Colab and navigate to the uploaded files in your Drive.
3. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```sh
    !pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset:
    - Ensure your dataset is available in the specified directory or upload it to Google Colab.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    - Open the notebook file in Google Colab.
    - Follow the instructions and run the cells sequentially to train and test the CNN model.
3. View the results:
    - The output will display the classification results for the leaves in the dataset.
